# Agenda

## Communications

In case of questions, send email to the abelgroup email list.
- Any questions are allowed, none are stupid!
- This may lead to quicker responses, and also informs the rest of the group

## Information files
Several directories have read-me files, read them!
- If there is a readme file in a directory, read it!
- The readme file describes catalogue structures, what is supposed to be inside the catalogue in question, etc.

Also: new feature: NEWS file
- The news file contain information on new programs, how to find them, etc.
- Also contains information on programs that doesn't work a the moment
- The person that updates the news file should also send an email to the abel email list

## Folder stucture

1. Directories
  * "Landing directory", like "/usit/abel/u1/karinlag" are free for your use, but no VI data should be kept there
  * All should have their own project home directory, this would be "/work/projects/nn9305k/home/karinlag".
    - All Veterinary Institute data should only be in the nn9305k project catalogue. We have a total of 20 TB of space available in that 
catalogue.
    - Your "landing directory" have about 500 GB of space available.
    - The project catalogue is not accessible unless your user have been given access to it, and read/write/execute permissions is given 
along with this this access. If you don't have access or need access for another user, send an email to the abel email group. Karin will 
add a tutorial on how to give or revoke read/write acces to files and directories.

2. Two types of projects:
  * shared projects: create a directory under nn9305k
    - Accessible to everyone that have access to the nn9305k catalogue
  * your own project: create a directory under your own home directory
    - Also accessible for everyone, but please do not ener other users home directories

3. All project should preferrably have the following directories:
  * rawdata - to keep raw data
    - Fastq-files, and other files that should not be modified
  * analysis - where analyses are done
    - Fastqc results, assemblies etc.
  * scripts - scripts used to run analyses
  * logs - a directory where you write down what you've done.

## Data storage

Basic idea: No PJS data for now, only sequencing data. This means that you might have to check your isolate names!

Please inform Karin of any data transfers to Abel before transferring data.
- If external data is to be downloaded to Abel, please identify how the files are stored at the remote location, then ask Karin how to 
proceed.

Please log all datasets in the DataREgistry file, and copy and fill out a samplefiles/README_datafile file for your project.
 - Name of project leader, responsible person on ABEL for the project, info on files, and info about the project should be added to the 
readme_datafile file.
