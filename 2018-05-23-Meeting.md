## Communications

In case of questions, send email to the abelgroup email list.

## Information files
Several directories have read-me files, read them!

Also: new feature: NEWS file

## Folder stucture

1. Directories
  * "Landing directory", like "/usit/abel/u1/karinlag" are free for your use, but no VI data should be kept there
  * All should have their own project home directory, this would be "/work/projects/nn9305k/home/karinlag".
2. Two types of projects:
  * shared projects: create a directory under nn9305k
  * your own project: create a directory under your own home directory
3. All project should preferrably have the following directories:
  * rawdata - to keep raw data
  * analysis - where analyses are done
  * scripts - scripts used to run analyses
  * logs - a directory where you write down what you've done.

## Data storage

Basic idea: No PJS data for now, only sequencing data. This means that you might have to check your isolate names!

Please inform Karin of any data transfers to Abel before transferring data.

Please log all datasets in the DataREgistry file, and copy and fill out a samplefiles/README_datafile file for your project.
